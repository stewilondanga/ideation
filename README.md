###### Capstone Project Ideation in Android
  At Moringa you are learning skills that you can use to solve your own problems: what is something that you want to see in 
the world? Use this time to build that product. We want our students to utilize their full potential during their time at 
Moringa School. In order to do that, it is up to each student to strive to attain that potential.As Software Engineers, our 
portfolios are the best way for us to share our abilities. When thinking of ideas for the products that you will build 
throughout your time at Moringa, make sure that you’re looking to build truly excellent projects rather than the status quo.
  No matter your goals post-Moringa School, for your portfolio to stand out to other developers, entrepreneurs, and hiring 
partners, it is important that your product ideas are innovative. Any average developer can recreate an existing product, 
your projects should represent that you can do more. That being said: not every project idea makes a good project. When 
choosing a project, is extremely important to maximize the following qualities:
- Clearly articulated, solid idea: projects should have a clear question or problem they are trying to solve plus a 
  reasonably specific proposed solution.
- Attainable: in our experience, students tend to overestimate their ability to produce and will accomplish about 25% of what
  they set out to accomplish in the limited time they have. Make sure that each project’s goals should be attainable so you 
  are able to feel accomplished at the end of the session.
- Innovative: at Moringa we have seen far too many projects that do the exact same thing. To have a truly world-class project, 
  we need to see you solving real problems. Take time to think of a real problem that you notice in society, and an 
  innovative way of solving that problem.
- Intentional: from the technical strategy behind your application, technologies used, to the design, producing excellent 
  products means paying attention to the details in the decisions you are making. Don’t take shortcuts, make something truly 
  incredible.

  You have been working hard over the past few months to learn incredible skills. Use this time to boost yourself to the next
level by building an awesome product with your skills. Below are guidelines to prompt your thinking in your project ideation.
For this project, don’t just create another ticket sales app, another ecommerce app, another uber for Boda Bodas - create, 
innovative, do something that matters and has some technical challenges for you to solve. You are becoming a software 
engineer, utilize and explore your technical skills and show employers that you’re really creating a strong product and give 
yourself opportunities to learn and push yourselves in your technical skills.
